# PeekAChu
Found Anna Chu in some Microsoft collateral, documentation, or slideware? Share it here.

Let's be clear about this. We love Anna. She rocks.
If anything, this repo pays homage to the awesomeness that is her and the fact that we get to see her across so many Microsoft artefacts.

You can also find some pics where we've tried to hijack the hashtag #PeekAChu on Twitter: https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeekAChu
